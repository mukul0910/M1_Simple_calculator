## User Requirement
you will have to choose numbers to perform the selected operation . For example,

Operations     | Operator  | Desired action | Result   
---------------|-----------|----------------|--------
`1_Addition`   |    +      | Adding val.    | (1`+`2) = 3
`2_subtraction`|    -      | Subtraction val.| (1`-`3) = -2
`etc`          |   ...    |   ...       | ... 

## Research
 From different websites and articles i have read about data types , constanats , loopings , if-else ,switch-case , different types of operators and its significance.
